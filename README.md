# Phototelectric-Simulator

This project is based on a quantum physics phenomenon called the Photoelectric Effect.I created a simulation to visually represent what happens when light of a certain frequency hits surfaces of various materials. In the photoelectric effect, electrons are emitted from a material when light hits its surface as it provides energy to be released. However, the electron could only be emitted if it receives enough energy, which is referred to as the work function of the material. The photoelectric effect also relies on the intensity of the light that is hitting the material. The higher the intensity of the light hitting the material, the more electrons are released due to the one-to-one interaction between photons and electrons meaning more photons more electrons are released. Different material have different work functions meaning the electrons on their surface will require different amount of energies to be released, therefore all material will have a different threshold frequency where for electrons to be released the frequency of the light has to be greater than the threshold frequency for any electron to be released. The remaining energy left from removing the electron is converted to kinetic energy. Electrons will have various kinetic energies depending on how deep they are.

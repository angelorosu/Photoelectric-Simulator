Trying to get the total kinetic energy i have experienced problems with not checking to what changedPhotonFrequency and when it
changhes so when i try get the value its treating changedPhotonFrequency as a zero.(function is in Maths class and i'm trying to 
change the label of the kinetic energy in mainwidow.cs)


In teh RGBConverter function convert the rgb values to type byte and return them as byte array to
be used to convert wavelength to rgb values in  mainwidow.cs
